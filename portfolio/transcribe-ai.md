Transcribe AI is built on OpenAI's powerful Whisper model, providing high accuracy and reliability.

Our transcription service uses Open AI's Whisper model to transcribe audio files into text, providing high accuracy and reliability. Billing is handled through Stripe, and charges are based on the length of the audio file transcribed, rounded to the nearest second. All transcriptions are securely stored on our platform and can be viewed, managed, and deleted by the user. Our transcription service is an efficient and reliable solution for converting audio to text, suitable for businesses, researchers, and individuals alike.
